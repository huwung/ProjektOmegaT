LAS VEGAS: Data analytics have been used in the enterprise for some time, but IBM claims that Watson will create an information revolution leading to companies becoming data-driven "cognitive businesses".
Bob Picciano, senior vice president of IBM Analytics, said at IBM Insight 2015 in Las Vegas that trends such as the growing digitalisation of companies and the rise of the Internet of Things are creating a deluge of data that businesses can tap into with the right tools.
"There's so much data at the edge being generated by billions of connected devices, sensors and services, and about 90 percent of that data is never captured. It's never analysed, and it's never actioned. That is a total waste. Just imagine if we could tap into all that data," he said.
理所當然地, Picciano將IBM Watson的認知計算能力吹捧為達成該目標的一種方法.
"Cognitive business is at the nexus of exploiting digital transformation and digital intelligence powered by capabilities like Watson,"他說.
