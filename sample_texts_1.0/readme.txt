Usage

The texts in this package are translations of the Tao Te Ching edited and published by Peter A. Merel. There are two versions, which in this package have "old" and "new" respectively in the filename. These correspond to the versions described as "an older version" and "2.0.7" as published by Peter A. Merel. This package does not contain the complete text, but only selected chapters. The file names contain the chapter numbers concerned.

The two versions constitute two English translations of the original Tao Te Ching text which are structurally sufficiently different to be regarded as similar but not identical texts. It is therefore possible to translate one of these versions (e.g. "old") using OmegaT, and then to translate the other ("new") with the aid of the translation memory generated during translation of the first version. Since OmegaT can handle multi-file projects, users can select any number of chapters from those available according to the amount of text needed.

The sample texts are suitable for: 

- learning the functions of OmegaT
- writing tutorials for OmegaT
- demonstrating OmegaT
- providing training in OmegaT.


Note

My modifications to these texts consist simply in selecting chapters with a suitable degree of similarity, converting to OpenOffice.org (.sxw) format, and packaging them.
